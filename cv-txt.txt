About me ____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Who am I?

I've been passionate about games, animation, and culture since I was a child. This passion led me to self-taught programming and digital arts, exploring areas such as concept art and 3D modeling. I'm currently pursuing a degree that combines technology and art, with the goal of creating creative experiences and helping people through my projects.
